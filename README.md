# foster-miller-crypto
A transcription and translation of Cynthia Anthonsen Foster and Kenneth R. Miller's three notes from 1921.

These notes were printed in the [Schlesinger Library's Fall 2017 newsletter](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/news/schlesinger-newsletter/calling-all-cryptologists), and the author of this repo summarily absconded from all other matters for the transliteration of this cipher.

The above should print the three letters, transliterated.
